Create a Knowledge Store with Azure Cognitive Search:

    Azure Cognitive Search uses an enrichment pipeline of cognitive skills to extract AI-generated fields from documents and include them in a search index. While the index might be considered the primary output from an indexing process, the enriched data it contains might also be useful in other ways. For example:

        - Since the index is essentially a collection of JSON objects, each representing an indexed record, it might be useful to export the objects as JSON files for integration into a data orchestration process using tools such as Azure Data Factory.
        - You may want to normalize the index records into a relational schema of tables for analysis and reporting with tools such as Microsoft Power BI.
        - Having extracted embedded images from documents during the indexing process, you might want to save those images as files.

    or

    1. Create a new resouce group
    2. run az login --output none
    3. run az account list-locations -o table
    4. In the output, find the Name value that corresponds with the location of your resource group (for example, for East US the corresponding name is eastus).
    5. In the setup.cmd script, modify the subscription_id, resource_group, and location.
    6. run Setup
    7. Output:
        - Storage account name
        - Storage connection string
        - Cognitive Services account
        - Cognitive Services key
        - Search service endpoint
        - Search service admin key
        - Search service query key

    
    Components of Search Solution:
        - A data source that references the documents in your Azure storage container.
        - A skillset that defines an enrichment pipeline of skills to extract AI-generated fields from the documents.
        - An index that defines a searchable set of document records.
        - An indexer that extracts the documents from the data source, applies the skillset, and populates the index.

    
Rest Interface:
    1. In 24-knowledge-store folder, expand the create-search folder and select data_source.json. 
    2. Replace the string that looks like this DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=ai102str123;AccountKey=12345abcdefg...==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net or YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING
    3. In the create-search folder, open skillset.json
    4. Replace YOUR_COGNITIVE_SERVICES_KEY
    5. At the end of the collection of skills in your skillset, find the Microsoft.Skills.Util.ShaperSkill skill named define-projection. This skill defines a JSON structure for the enriched data that will be used for the projections that the pipeline will persist on the knowledge store for each document processed by the indexer.

    6. At the bottom of the skillset file, observe that the skillset also includes a knowledgeStore definition, which includes a connection string for the Azure Storage account where the knowledge store is to be created, and a collection of projections. This skillset includes three projection groups:

        - A group containing an object projection based on the knowledge_projection output of the shaper skill in the skillset.
        - A group containing a file projection based on the normalized_images collection of image data extracted from the documents.
        - A group containing the following table projections:
            - KeyPhrases: Contains an automatically generated key column and a keyPhrase column mapped to the knowledge_projection/key_phrases/ collection output of the shaper skill.
            - Locations: Contains an automatically generated key column and a location column mapped to the knowledge_projection/key_phrases/ collection output of the shaper skill.
            - ImageTags: Contains an automatically generated key column and a tag column mapped to the knowledge_projection/image_tags/ collection output of the shaper skill.
            - Docs: Contains an automatically generated key column and all of the knowledge_projection output values from the shaper skill that are not already assigned to a table.
    7. Replace the YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING
    8. In the create-search folder, open create-search.cmd.
    9. Replace the YOUR_SEARCH_URL and YOUR_ADMIN_KEY variable placeholders with the Url and one of the admin keys for your Azure Cognitive Search resource.\
    10. Right-click the the create-search folder and select Open in Integrated Terminal.Run create-search
    11. In  Azure Cognitive Search resource, select the Indexers page and wait for the indexing process to complete.
